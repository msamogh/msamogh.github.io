title: "Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Human Learner Actions? A Simulation Authoring Framework for Open-Ended Learning Environments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/llm-simulation-human-learner-actions
excerpt: 'This paper introduces Hyp-Mix, a novel simulation authoring framework that leverages GPT-4 Turbo to reliably simulate human learner behaviors in open-ended interactive learning environments. By addressing key limitations of current LLM-based simulation approaches, Hyp-Mix demonstrates calibrated and realistic learner actions, paving the way for more effective stress-testing and adaptation prototyping.'
