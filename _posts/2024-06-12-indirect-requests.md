title: "IndirectRequests: Making Task-Oriented Dialogue Datasets More Natural by Synthetically Generating Indirect User Requests"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/indirectrequests
excerpt: 'Enhancing the naturalness of task-oriented dialogue systems, IndirectRequests introduces a dataset of Indirect User Requests (IURs) generated using large language models. This dataset bridges the gap between machine-generated and human-like conversations, providing a robust testbed for advancing natural language understanding and dialogue state tracking.'
