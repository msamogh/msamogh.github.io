I'm Amogh Mannekote. I'm a second-year PhD student working with [Dr. Kristy Boyer](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/boyer-kristy). I'm part of the [LearnDialogue](http://learndialogue.org/) group at the University of Florida.

My research interest broadly falls at the intersection of dialogue systems, natural language processing, and human-centered computing. I'm currently working on developing methods to enable situated dialogue systems in a CS-Ed context for young learners, which is a "long-tail" domain for NLP. Here is my latest [research statement](https://github.com/msamogh/msamogh.github.io/blob/04b64929fb314e9b92255eb6ac57585faf47e807/Research_Statement.pdf).

#### Open Source Contributions
I'm a sucker for well-written, reusable code and try to contribute to open source whenever possible.
- [nonechucks](https://github.com/msamogh/nonechucks) was one such project that was born out of a personal frustration with PyTorch's data-handling modules, which turned into a pretty widely used PyTorch "add-on" (although I don't actively maintain it any more).
- [Rasa-FRAMES](https://github.com/msamogh/rasa-frames) was another project that I worked on to write a proof-of-concept library that would enable the replication of slots across multiple frames in a conversation.
- I have also contributed to [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and [Rasa](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa).
